## Version 2.0.0

* **[Breaking Change]** Flattened the structure of the `types` folder a bit, removing the redundant `amazon-selling-partner-api` folder.
* Each file in the `types` folder is also not exported as an object to simplify imports.
* Fixed the name of the file for the `AmazonSellingParterOrdersAPIClient` class.
